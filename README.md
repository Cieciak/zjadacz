# zjadacz

Parser combinator library written in Python.  
It's simple, greedy, and doesn't handle recursion.  

BUT

It works for **me**.

## Installing

1. Install using pip3
    ```
    pip3 install zjadacz
    ```


## Building

1. Clone repository
    ```
    git clone https://github.com/Cieciak/zjadacz.git

2. Initialize Python virtual enviroment
   ```
   make init
   ```

3. Build the package
   ```

    Output will be in `dist` folder
